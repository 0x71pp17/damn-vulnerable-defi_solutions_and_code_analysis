     * SOLUTION - test_withdrawal()
     * =========================================================
     * Attack: operator finalize-without-proof + neutralize the malicious leaf
     * The player has OPERATOR_ROLE, so finalizeWithdrawal() skips Merkle proof
     * verification and accepts ANY (nonce, l2Sender, target, timestamp, message).
     * Leaf #2 in the set is a forged 999,000 DVT withdrawal that would drain the
     * bridge. The gateway marks a leaf finalized regardless of whether its inner
     * call succeeds, so we make leaf #2's transfer FAIL while still finalizing it:
     * 1. Warp past the 7-day delay (cheatcode, not a tx).
     * 2. Finalize a crafted withdrawal that calls executeTokenWithdrawal with the
     *    bridge itself as receiver for 1,100 DVT: token balance is unchanged
     *    (self-transfer) but totalDeposits drops to 998,900.
     * 3. Finalize the four real leaves with their original params. Leaf #2's inner
     *    executeTokenWithdrawal underflows (998,900 - 999,000) and reverts inside
     *    the forwarder, so failedMessages is set but the gateway still finalizes
     *    the leaf and bumps counter - zero tokens drained.
     * 4. Leaves #0/#1/#3 each move a legit 10 DVT (30 total, well under 1%).
     *
     * No player-nonce constraint here, so the calls are made inline.
